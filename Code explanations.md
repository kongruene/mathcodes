λ
This code calculates the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a system matrix formed from stiffness, damping, and mass matrices typically used in structural dynamics or control systems. The stiffness matrix M^(-1) K, damping matrix M^(-1) C, and identity matrices are used to construct the upper and lower blocks of A, with the upper block including zero matrices and identity matrices, and the lower block using the stiffness and damping matrices. These blocks are vertically stacked to form the complete system matrix A. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors are computed using the eig function from scipy.linalg, which helps analyze the dynamic behaviour, including natural frequencies and modes of the system.

s(t) and s'(t)
The provided Python code solves and visualizes the equations of motion for a bridge's three degrees of freedom (lateral, vertical, and torsional) using solve_ivp from SciPy for numerical integration and Matplotlib for plotting. Each motion is modeled as a system of first-order differential equations incorporating damping, stiffness, and external forcing terms, with initial conditions s(0)=0 and s ̇(0)=0. The simulation spans 10 seconds with 1000 evaluation points, yielding displacement s(t) and velocity s ̇(t) for each motion type. Results are plotted in six subplots, where columns represent s(t) and s ̇(t), and rows correspond to lateral, vertical, and torsional motions, highlighting dynamic differences across degrees of freedom.

s3(t) and s3’(t) in radians
This code numerically solves and visualizes the motion of a system with three degrees of freedom: lateral, vertical, and torsional. Using the solve_ivp function from SciPy, it integrates differential equations for each motion type over a specified time span. The system equations incorporate stiffness, damping, and sinusoidal forcing terms. Initial conditions are set to zero for displacement and velocity. Time evaluations are done over 1000 points across 10 seconds. The torsional motion and its velocity are divided by 6 to convert to radians, and results are plotted in subplots, showing the torsional displacement and velocity. The plots use distinct labels and colours for clear interpretation.
